.SH "DESCRIPTION"

To abstract the plugin developer from logfile and GUI related stuff, the
plugins utilize reporting object named self._reporting. Developer can use
it to send messages to whatever frontend the user is using.

The reporting system si also thread safe, so the developer does not have
to care about locks and synchronization.
